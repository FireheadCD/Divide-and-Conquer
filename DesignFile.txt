Divide and Conquer
Call Upon the middle of the element chosen.
Adjust pivot in arrays if the combined elements are less than the nth value
We compare each value of the two arrays at the pivot points, and we can decide where to search from there
If its smaller we go higher, if its larger, then we go smaller

int[] A = {0, 6, 19, 25, 96, 201, 9001};
int[] B = {1, 15, 111, 202, 9000};

we take the pivot in the middle of the arrays, and we go from there
For example, the 4th largest element should be 201
